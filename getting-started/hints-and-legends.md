# Hints and Legends

This Documentation will contain certain symbols, characters, hints and different font colors which will have their own specific meanings. \
\
This page will help you with those.

## Characters and Symbols

* `< >` This symbol means the arguments written inside it are **required arguments** i.e. commands cannot be executed without them.
* `[ ]` This symbol means the arguments written inside it are **optional arguments** i.e. commands can be executed even without them.
* `Option 1 | Option 2` This means the command has **options** inside it.
* `Option 1 \ Option 2` This means at least **one of the options** needs to be used in order to run the command.
* ‚≠ê Features with this emoji beside them mean they are premium features and require an active [RILP BOT Premium Subscription](../premium.md)

Note: You do not need to include  `< >` or `[ ]` while running the commands.

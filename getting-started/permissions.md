# Permissions

{% hint style="success" %}
Giving Bot administrator will directly grant it all the perms required in general as well as in a particular channel.\
Though if you still wish to give perms manually you can read the guide ahead....
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you are setting up perms manually make sure to provide the bot perms in all those channels where everyone role doesn't have it.\
Like for example bot needs perms to see all those channels where you want invites to get counted.
{% endhint %}

# Auto Roles

### Auto Roles

Set the roles you want the bot to give to **users** upon someone joining the server.

{% hint style="info" %}
The roles given for auto role upon user join are given only to human accounts and not to bot accounts.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can set up to **3 roles** while you can set **unlimited** with Premium Subscription.
{% endhint %}

### Rule Acceptance&#x20;

RILP BOT waits for the users to accept the server rules ([membership screening](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000466882-Rules-Screening-FAQ)) before giving them the roles.

### Verification Acceptance

RILP BOT waits for the user to complete the RILP BOT [verification](verification-captcha.md) before giving them the roles.

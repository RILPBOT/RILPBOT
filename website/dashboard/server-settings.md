# Server Settings

### Moderator Only

Enabling this would make all the commands **Moderator Only** meaning the bot will only respond to commands when used by a user who has a [Moderator Role](server-settings.md#moderator-role) or <mark style="color:green;">ADMINISTRATOR</mark> or <mark style="color:green;">MANAGE SERVER</mark> Permission.

### Bot Nickname

Anything entered would be set as Bot's nickname in the server.\
(Please note this will not actually change the bot's name but just set a nickname for the bot in the server)

### ‚≠ê Fake Delay

Defines the minimum number of days an account should be old in order to be counted as a normal invite. Any account below the set amount would be counted as a suspicious (fake) invite.

### Moderator Role

Select the roles you want to set as moderator roles for RILP BOT meaning they would be able to use all the moderation commands like **Kick**, **Mute,** etc.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can set up to 5 roles as Moderator Role and up to 50 with <mark style="color:yellow;">Premium</mark>.
{% endhint %}

### Auto Nickname
